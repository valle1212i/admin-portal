## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Email Infrastructure
- Email service is configured with Brevo SMTP
- Awaiting SMTP approval before emails will actually send
- All email functions are ready and will work once SMTP is approved
- Test mode available to verify email templates

### External Integrations (Stubbed)
The following integrations are stubbed and return mock data:
- **Bolagsverket** - Swedish company registry lookup
- **BankID** - Digital identity verification
- **VIES** - EU VAT number validation
- **Stripe** - Payment processing

To implement real integrations:
1. Add API credentials to `.env`
2. Uncomment TODO sections in `services/externalIntegrations.js`
3. Replace mock returns with actual API calls

### File Uploads
- Uploads are stored in `uploads/onboarding/` directory
- This directory will be created automatically
- Ensure proper permissions are set
- Consider cloud storage (S3, Cloudinary) for production
